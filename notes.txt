Most of the time you will need to do these steps:
1. When complete with work and want to update github
    git add .
    git commit -m "any text that describes your changes"
    git push
2. you might have to git pull -r if it complains


Create a local web server
1. npm install -g http-server
2. http-server
you might have to run npm install if things aren't working
